		My name is Muhammad Thaqif, I’m 21 years old. I live with my family, which consists of dad, mom, and my sister Thira, who is a year older than me. My constitution is average and growth too. I’m quite likable externally, but not as handsome as I would like to be, unfortunately. I respect myself, although I do not try to make myself a leader or head of the company. At the same time, I will not let myself be offended and try to make sure that my opinion is respected by both relatives and friends. I often stand in my opinion. It’s not so easy for me to change it even under the weight of some respectable arguments. Someone can consider that it is wrong, but I like to be independent in everything I am doing. My close people and friends know this feature in me and consider it avoiding unnecessary arguments or conversations.

			I studied at school on the average level not being a perfect pupil though trying not to be the last as well. From all of the subjects most of all I liked mathematics, physics, and geography. I like mathematics because it is connected with the logic to me. I enjoy logical games and everything connected to that. I like biology because it gives us insight into the world of creation of everything living on the Earth. It seems amazing and unknown, thus worth to be discovered. I like geography simply because I like to discover different cultures. I would not say that I am a devoted traveler as I mainly enjoy sitting in the comfort of my home. Though, I like to discover something new. Hopefully, nowadays we can travel virtually taking amazing 360-degree tours using smartphones or computers and thus “traveling” everywhere we want from the comfort of the sofa.

			I am a sociable person. I like to get acquainted with new people, communicate in a big company, participate in disputes. Among my friends, there are boys and girls. I would call myself a benevolent person, often I help my friends. If I can say that I have learned purposefulness from my father, the same I can admit that my mother learnt me to be helpful to people no matter of sex or race. I was brought up in a multi-cultured community and I consider the people of all nations to be equal. I have learned to accept the right both of men and women for independence and self-realization. I think that such understandings together with a willingness to help all the people in need make a socially responsible individual out of me.
